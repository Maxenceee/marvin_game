You may need to remove macro statement in some files and there's missing features.

### Quick start

Run `make gen` to compile and start the program. You can add params using the argument `GVAR`.

Example:
```sh
make gen GVAR="-c 200 -p /Users/maxence/Documents"
```

Clone and start:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Maxenceee/marvin_game.git && cd marvin_game && make gen
```

### Details

Compile the project using `make all` then compile the executables "poison" and "healer" with `make execs`. Once done start the program running `./marvin_game`, adding params if needed.

To fix averything run `make execs && ./healer`
